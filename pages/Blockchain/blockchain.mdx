## Node Management
The node management system in the Walnut Network handles the following key components:
![Node Management](/assets/docs/v1.0.1/blockchain/node_management.png)

### Set up new worker

- Check whether the node is registered
- Connect the node to the network
- Collect information about the node

### Register node

- Register the node
- Register node event
- Complete the node registration process

### Join cluster

- Check if the node meets the requirements of the cluster
- Connect the node to the cluster
- Get the node ID and cluster ID

### Leave cluster

- Initial setup for leaving the cluster
- Get the node ID and cluster ID
- Complete the process of leaving the cluster

This system ensures proper management and allocation of resources across the network by handling tasks like registering new nodes, connecting them, and managing their cluster membership.

<Steps>
### User Management System
- Register Consumers and Providers
- Manage wallet addresses and account roles
- Handle authentication and authorization

### Resource Allocation Mechanism
- Track available CPU/GPU resources
- Monitor node uptime and performance
- Dynamically allocate resources to Consumers

### Task Management Protocol
- Submit computational tasks
- Match tasks with optimal Providers
- Track task progress and status

### Reward Calculation Engine
- Calculate Provider rewards
- Process secure transactions
- Ensure transparent compensation
</Steps>
